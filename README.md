# 🦀 rust-up-knowledge

**rust-up-knowledge** is my **personal Rust knowledge base** — a big, evolving cheatsheet built while working through  
**_The Rust Programming Language (2021 Edition)_** (aka *the Rust Book*).

Instead of focusing on runnable code or projects, this repo is about:
> collecting, compressing, and revisiting Rust knowledge in a way that’s easy to skim, recall, and “brush up” later.

(Yes, the name is a playful take on *“brush up knowledge”*.)

## 📘 Source Material

- Book: *The Rust Programming Language (2021 Edition)*
- Official link: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
- Rust edition: **2021**

The Rust Book is the backbone, but this repo also includes:
- Personal explanations
- Mental models
- Common pitfalls
- Patterns worth remembering
- “Why this exists” notes

---

## 🎯 Purpose & Philosophy

This repository is **not**:
- A tutorial
- A set of polished examples
- A Cargo workspace
- A reference replacement for the official docs

This repository **is**:
- A **personal cheatsheet**
- A **Rust memory refresher**
- A place to dump “things I finally understood”
- A long-term Rust companion

Think of it as:
> *Notes I wish I had when coming back to Rust after a few months.*

## 🧠 How It’s Structured

Each Rust Book chapter maps to a **single knowledge file or section**, focused on **concepts**, not code volume.

The idea is that each chapter acts like a **drop-down box of distilled knowledge** — something I can quickly open, skim, and close.

Example structure:

```
.
├── chapters/
│   ├── 01_hello_world.md
│   ├── 02_guessing_game.md
│   ├── 03_common_concepts.md
│   ├── 04_ownership.md
│   ├── 05_structs.md
│   ├── 06_enums_and_match.md
│   ├── 07_packages_crates_modules.md
│   ├── 08_collections.md
│   ├── 09_error_handling.md
│   ├── 10_generics_traits_lifetimes.md
│   ├── 11_testing.md
│   ├── 12_io_project.md
│   ├── 13_functional_language_features.md
│   ├── 14_more_about_cargo.md
│   ├── 15_smart_pointers.md
│   ├── 16_fearless_concurrency.md
│   ├── 17_oop_features.md
│   ├── 18_patterns_and_matching.md
│   ├── 19_advanced_features.md
│   └── 20_final_project.md
└── README.md
```

## ✍️ What Each Chapter Contains

Each chapter file typically includes:
- Short explanations in my own words
- Key rules and invariants
- Rust-specific terminology
- Common mistakes and compiler complaints
- “This finally clicked when…” notes
- Minimal code snippets **only when helpful**

The emphasis is always on **understanding and recall**, not completeness.

## 🧭 How I Use This Repo

- As a **study companion** while reading the Rust Book
- As a **quick refresher** before writing Rust again
- As a place to solidify concepts that felt confusing the first time
- As a low-pressure space to write things *for myself*, not an audience

This repo may contain:
- Redundant explanations
- Over-simplifications
- Opinions
- Notes that only make sense to me

That’s intentional 🙂
