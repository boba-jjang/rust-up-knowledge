This chapter covers concepts that most programmers are already familiar with:
variables, functions, data types, and control flow.

Because of that, my plan here is **not** to re-teach these ideas from scratch.  
Instead, I will briefly summarize each concept as it appears in the book, focusing on **how Rust approaches them differently**.

Rust frames these familiar ideas with a very specific mindset:
- correctness over convenience
- explicitness over assumptions
- compile-time guarantees over runtime surprises

This chapter is not about *learning what variables or functions are*.  
It’s about understanding **how Rust thinks about these ideas**, and what rules it enforces around them.

There may also be places where I include extra details that go beyond the basics.  
When that happens, those sections are meant to be **optional**; useful if you’re curious, but safe to skip if you just want the core idea.
