Rust programs go through three conceptual phases:

Analysis (Rust’s “superpower”)
Ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, types, traits — all checked before code runs.

Code Generation
Rust compiles your code into low-level object files via LLVM.

Linking
A linker combines those object files with libraries into a final executable.
